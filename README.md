# Project Outline


This project involves the simple use of logistic regression model to strategize a basic ad-targeting campaign for a social media network/website.

The dataset used for this project was colected from Kaggle. 

This dataset contain variables such as:

User id
Gender
Age
Estimated Salary
Purchased

Each variable analysis to find out which can be used to maximize clicking through rate.  

It was concluded that  accuracy was high but not very high to do any overfitting. Also, it can be seen from the heatmap graph that if there is an incerease in age and estimated salary it will likely to lead a higher probability of clicking the advertisment.
